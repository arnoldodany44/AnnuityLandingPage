For this project, I exclusively used React, TailwindCSS, and FontAwesome.

To initiate the projectIn the project directory, you can run:
`npm install` followed by `npm start`.

I spent roughly 3 and a half hours on this task and began it just today.

I chose to employ TailwindCSS with React because of its sheer simplicity and the webpage did not present any complex elements. Implementing a responsive design with Tailwind is straightforward, so I faced no issues in that aspect. Under typical circumstances, I would have further modularized the components, but given that there was no need for reuse in this context, it wasnâ€™t deemed necessary.

The only minor hiccup was the icon within the select box not being perfectly centered horizontally. Nonetheless, the design was uncomplicated and I am pleased with the outcomes.
